# BMS - Book Management System

## Backend Setup
Setup venv:
1. `python3 -m venv backend/venv`
2. `source backend/venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`

This also requires sqlite3

`python3 -m flask run`

This will run a local development server on port 5000.

## Frontend Setup
From the frontend directory:
`npm install`

Now that everything is installed to start the application, the following command can be ran to start it. This must still be ran from the current directory of ‘readpact’:

`npm start`
